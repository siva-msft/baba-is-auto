baba-is-auto is Baba Is You simulator using C++ with some reinforcement learning. The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. baba-is-auto currently supports macOS (10.14 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build baba-is-auto.

## What is "Baba Is You"?

[Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/) is an award-winning puzzle game where you can change the rules by which you play. In every level, the rules themselves are present as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.

## Key Features

  * C++17 based Baba Is You library
  * Various RL environments based on OpenAI Gym
  * GUI simulator using `pygame`
  * C++ and Python API

cd baba-is-auto
```

### C++ API

For macOS or Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For Windows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
MSBuild baba-is-auto.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```
